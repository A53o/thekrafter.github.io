# Krafter's Realm Season 2 Changelog
All of the things we've changed in Season 2 of the SMP:

- Minecraft 1.20!
- No longer hosted in a Docker Container
- Connections go through the Velocity proxy before connecting to the internal minecraft server (this will help ease these kinds of transitions)
- No more teleportation! (Including `/back`, `/home`, `/warp`, and `/tpa`)
- Death chests last 24 hours
- The map has moved to [https://thekrafter.github.io/kraftersrealm/map](/kraftersrealm/map)
- You only get +60 claim blocks per hour (previously it was +100)
- Map art is no longer allowed and will be removed (Rule 9)
- Several of overpowered extra crafting recipies have been removed (and there's a new list of recipies [here](/kraftersrealm/crafting))
- After 30 days (previously 21) when your claim gets automatically removed, nature is restored
- You can't open trapdoors in claims you're not trusted in
- You *can* read lecterns in claims you're not trusted in
- There is a new page on our claiming system [here](/kraftersrealm/claims)
- There are new rules for using minecraft mods [here](/kraftersrealm/mods)
- There's a link to documentation for Shopkeepers [here](/kraftersrealm/shopkeepers)
- We have a wishlist on potential upgrades for the server [here](/kraftersrealm/wishlist)
- All of these guides I've linked to are listed on [this new page](/kraftersrealm)
- We have a fancy new tab menu on java edition
- Messages from discord look prettier ingame
- Our anticheat plugin was removed, as it does not support 1.20 and we haven't had a real need for it (it was just uselessly wasting server resources)
- The map no longer has to be manually updated every week
- Claims now only have to be a minimum 5 by 4 blocks large
- The server has updated from Fedora Server 36 to Fedora Server 37
- There's a nice little hut at spawn (with the shop to shop for shopkeepers for your shops)
- Minecraft users chatting in `#ingame-chat` no longer have `[MC]` after their username
- The autocomplete for commands now only shows commands you can use
- We now have a secret panel (just for me) to see general server statistics (like performance and player count over time)
