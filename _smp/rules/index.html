	<h1>The KrafterSMP</h1></ br>
	</ br> <p><code>(You can report rulebreakers in #report on the discord server, just be sure to reference which rule they have broken and where they have broken it.)</code></p>
	<h4>1. Be nice</h4>
	</ br><p>This one is pretty easy, don't be a pain in the butt. One annoying player can make others not want to play, and then you have a dead server. If you're joining to bug people, get a life dude.</p>
	</ br><h4>2. Don't Cheat</h4>
	</ br><p>Hacking, duping, or any means of exploiting broken code (aka glitches or bugs) is unfair. If you want to get rich, freakin' get good at the game. Also, if you create a lag machine, you will get an instant ban from the server, machine removed, and if we find you out, you will be publicly shamed.</p>
	</ br><h4>3. This is an SMP</h4>
	</ br><p>You're supposed to be freindly, don't do things for no reason. If someone is being mean, feel free to kill them. Play pranks on people, troll people, lead them on wild goose chases, do what you want. But any actions you take can cuse reason for others to retaliate. This SMP server is more like the HermitCraft series in the way that you shouldn't steal, greif etc.</p>
	</ br><h4>4. Feel free to create content</h4>
	</ br><p>If you're a YouTuber, Twitch streamer, or content creator of any kind, feel free to create content on this server! Just please make sure to have a link in the description to <a href="/smp">https://thekrafter.github.io/smp</a> and put the name of the KrafterSMP in the video title.</p>
	</ br><h4>5. PRIVACY, PRIVACY, PRIVACY!</h4>
	</ br><p>If you know someone on the server personally, great. We don't want to hear about it. Understand the boundaries between people's personal and private lives. Don't give out details about yourself or others (Real names, school, age, job, etc.) </p>
	</ br><h4>6. No Sexually Explicit stuff</h4>
	</ br><p>This is probably one of the most important rules on the server. (And no, this doesn't include swearing, which is fine unless you're doing it exessively) Any sexually explicit speech, photographs, links, minecraft builds, etc. will be removed, and result in an instant ban. This is because some sheltered little babies could join the server at any time, and we don't want anyone to be introduced to those things. And the discord ToS (which you should read becuse, well, <a href="https://www.tosdr.org/">ToS;DR.org</a>) forbid it and I will report you.</p>
	</ br><h4>7. Don't be that one guy...</h4>
	</ br><p>You know him, that guy that spams everyone with pings, that beds for resources, that breaks rule #1 every second of his life, etc.</p>
	</ br><h4>8. Use common sense</h4>
	</ br><p>This list of rules could easily be thousands of lines long, but one, I'm too lazy. And two, you almost certaily wouldn't read it. If you think a rule should be on this list, imagine that it is. this isn't an exhaustive list of rules. I feel like people will break rule #8 a lot.</p>
	</ br><h4>9. Stay active</h4>
	</ br><p>If we find that you're not joining often, or at all, we reserve the right to give your slot to someone else. We don't want our 15 slots taken up by people who never join</p>
	</ br><h4>10. AFK responsibly</h4>
	</ br><p>I know that makes it sound like AFK is alcohol, but If you're going to AFK, please let people know. Don't AFK for too long, especially if that means keeping a lag-enducing redstone machine or automatic farm loaded. And, if someone wants to sleep,  tell them in chat if you can or can't sleep. Silence will be taken to mean you're AFK.</p>
	</ br><h4>11. The Server has limited storage</h4>
	</ br><p>At the time of server launch, the hard drive in the computer is only 40GB. I plan to upgrade to an external SSD for the server files soon, but even then, don't excessively load chunks unless you really need to. If the world gets too big, then the server could crash, and be down until I can get a bigger drive.
