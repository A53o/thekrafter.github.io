# Krafter
## Hey! I'm Krafter. 
I do a bit of contribution to FOSS projects, ([see my GitHub Stars](https://github.com/TheKrafter?tab=stars))

I am a Linux user, and I use [Fedora](https://getfedora.org) on my desktop and laptop. My phone is a [PinePhonePro](https://www.pine64.org/pinephonepro/) running [Mobian](https://mobian.org) (at time of writing) and has served me quite well so far, tho I don't heavily rely on my phone for anything important besides 2fa. I self-host a few things for myself, but nothing too important. 

I also play games! Well, I really just play minecraft. Sometimes modded, usually vanilla. [This is the pack I use for vanilla servers](/files/mc-client/krafter-mcpack-v0.1.zip), based on [trainb0y's better visuals](https://modrinth.com/modpack/trainb0ys-visual-pack).

PC enthusiast? I am too! I mostly watch [LTT](https://www.youtube.com/c/LinusTechTips).
