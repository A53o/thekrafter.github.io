# Krafter

## Hey! I'm Krafter.
 
I do a bit of contribution to FOSS projects, because there are so many great projects our there ([see my GitHub Stars](https://github.com/TheKrafter?tab=stars))

I am a Linux user, and I use [Fedora](https://getfedora.org) on my desktop and laptop. My phone is a [OnePlus 6](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/OnePlus_6_(oneplus-enchilada)) running [postmarketOS](https://postmarketos.org/) (at time of writing) and I must say Mobile Linux has been amazing so far, if you know enough about Linux so solve small issues and don't rely on any proprietary Android/iOS apps. I self-host a few things for myself aswell, but nothing too important. 

I also play games! Well, I really just play minecraft. Sometimes modded, usually vanilla. [This is the pack I use for vanilla servers](/files/mc-client/krafter-mcpack-v0.1.zip), based on [trainb0y's better visuals](https://modrinth.com/modpack/trainb0ys-visual-pack).

PC enthusiast? [I am too!](/pc) I mostly watch [LTT](https://www.youtube.com/c/LinusTechTips). 

## Projects

- [Tiramisu](https://github.com/RoseSMP/Tiramisu): an open-source all-purpose, extensible discord bot for communities, with elegance and simplicity in mind.
- [Groupings](https://github.com/TheKrafter/Groupings): A **very WIP** GroupMe client in Python and GTK4/Libadwaita
- [MolarMass](https://github.com/TheKrafter/MolarMass): A crappy low-feature molar mass calculator in GTK + Python, that I have yet to figure out how to make adaptive.
