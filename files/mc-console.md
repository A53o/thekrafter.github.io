# Joining on Consoles

Minecraft Bedrock edition for consoles does not officially support third-party servers, but there is a way around it.

Here is the reccommended way to join if you *must* use a console:

1. Find the DNS settings in your console's settings
2. Change the Primary DNS server to `104.238.130.180` *(or `45.55.68.52` on Playstation)*, and the Secondary DNS server to `1.1.1.1`.
  - *If there are no Primary/Secondary DNS server options, enter each option in order separated by a comma*
4. In Minecraft, go to the Servers tab, and join any one of the Featured Servers
5. Now, instead of joining a featured server, you should see a menu appear with the list of featured servers and a button that says "Connect to a Server" at the top
6. Click on "Connect to a Server", and type in the IP of the server you wish to join, and `19132` for the Port. Make sure to turn on "add to server list"
7. Click "Submit" and you will join this server, and it will be added to your list of servers for next time you join.
